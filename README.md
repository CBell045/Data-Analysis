# Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze a car dataset and determine what a good price is for different makes, models, and odometer readings. 

I got the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data). The dataset is used car data from Craigslist. It contains 25 columns and 458,213 rows. 

I am currently dreaming of buying a truck, and I want to make sure that when I do, I get a good car for a good price. 

Below is a link to my software demo video.
