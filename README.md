# Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze a car dataset and determine what a good price is for different makes, models, and odometer readings. 

I got the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data). The dataset is used car data from Craigslist. It contains 25 columns and 458,213 rows. 

I am currently dreaming of buying a truck, and I want to make sure that when I do, I get a good car for a good price. 

Below is a link to my software demo video.

# Data Analysis Results

Question: What is a good price for a Toyota Tacoma with 100,000 miles on it?
Answer: Typically, a Toyota Tacoma with 100,000 miles on it is listed for $20,000. Anything below $15,000 is a good deal.

Question: What is an equivalent price for a Ford truck? 
Answer: Fords tend to sell for a little more, at around $24,000. 

# Development Environment

I used VSCode and Python 3.10 to develop this project. 

The pandas, plotly, and dash libraries were essential to this project. I also used the Flatly bootstrap theme. 

# Useful Websites

These websites helped me as I worked on this project:
* [Python Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction)
* [Flatly Bootstrap Theme](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/)

# Future Work

* List specific questions and answers on the app
* Get user input (slider) on mile range
* Combine the two callbacks into one to avoid duplication
